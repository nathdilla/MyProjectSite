Basic HTML site. The site features links, side bars, and several tags like headings, titles, images, tables, indents, italics, etc. The site is supposed
to demonstrate the basics of HTML and CSS. This site specifically is Beatles themed, including a landing page, a page about their music, a page about their
instruments, a page about their history and a link to the official site. I used CSS to create shadowing and boxes around text. There is a non functional form
at the bottom of the page for newsletter subscribing.

I worked on this site entirely by myself. I used W3Schools and prior knowledge of HTML and CSS to aid me in the development of this site.
